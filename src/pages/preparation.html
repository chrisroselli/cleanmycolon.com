      <h1>Preparation and After Care</h1>
<h3>DIETARY GUIDELINES</h3>
<p>For a day or two before and after a session, drink lots of fltered or distilled water, herbal teas, and fresh juices, along with eating fresh, organic and seasonal vegetables, fruits, whole grains, soups, and lighter proteins. Eating this way naturally creates a healthier intestinal cleansing atmosphere and also reduces the possibilities of both excess gas build-up and delay in resuming your proper elimination function.</p>

<p>The following are examples of healthy, cleansing foods to include:</p>
<div class="small-12 columns">
<ul>
    <li>Herbal teas – chamomile, dandelion, ginger, green, peppermint</li>
    <li>Fruits – apricots, bananas, blueberries, figs, grapes, melons, oranges, papayas, peaches, pears, prunes</li>
    <li>Protein shakes – hempseed, rice, or whey</li>
    <li>Proteins – fish, poultry, seeds, tempeh, tofu</li>
    <li>Juices – fruit and vegetable</li>
    <li>Vegetables – preferably seasonal, beets, celery, cucumber, parsnips, squashes, sweet potatoes, sprouts, yams; leafy greens such as collard, kale, lettuces, mustard, swiss chard, watercress, parsley</li>
    <li>Seaweeds – dulse, kelp, kombu, nori</li>
    <li>Whole grains – amaranth, barley, basmati rice, buckwheat, long grain brown rice, millet, quinoa</li>
    <li>Breads (if you must) – gluten-free, Ezekiel’s Food for Life, or Manna varieties</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Minimize your consumption of dairy, sugar, wheat, and red meat and please remember to chew thoroughly!</p>

<h3>DAY OF THE SESSION</h3>
<p>On the day of your session, eat or drink mostly vegetables and fruits. This puts your body into a deeper cleansing mode. Remember water. However, try to avoid eating or drinking for two hours before your appointment so that you’re not digesting or needing to empty your bladder during your session.</p>

<p>After your session you may eat and drink as soon as you’d like, following the above recommendation. Electrolyte-type drinks, such as Emergen-C and Recharge, are suggested along with a probiotic supplement or food including acidophilus and bifidus, like goat’s yoghurt or kefir. Also consider miso, sauerkraut, rejuvelac, and chlorophyll-rich foods, such as wheat grass, dark greens, or algae. This is an excellent time to juice.</p>

<h3>AFTER THE SESSION</h3>
<p>It is not uncommon for 1-3 days to pass before your first bowel movement after a session. Please be patient. The whole digestive tract is one long tube (7 times the length of your body if stretched out!) so it may take some time for your colon to refill. What you eat and drink will determine how the redefining of your colon’s shape and movement will occur. Remember to drink lots of water. If you are particularly sensitive, avoid raw vegetables, red meat, and alcohol. Please avoid overeating.</p>

<p>Until you have a bowel movement, we suggest that you eliminate foods that you know to be allergic, constipating, gas producing and bloating. Some of these may be:</p>
<div class="small-12 columns">
<ul>
    <li>Bread, cheese, chocolate, desserts, fatty &amp; fried foods, ice cream, junk &amp; processed foods, milk, sugar &amp; wheat products, along with caffeine, carbonated drinks, and sodas</li>
    <li>Gas-producing foods: beans, cruciferous vegetables (such as broccoli, brussels sprouts, cabbage, and caulifower), onions, peppers, raw &amp; unpeeled apples, and soy products</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>OTHER EATING TIPS</h3>
<p>No matter which foods you prefer, fresh, organic, and seasonal are musts. There are many beneficial eating systems to choose from within the health food spectrum ranging from raw foods to macrobiotics. Dr. Peter D’Adamo’s Eat Right for Your Type and Live Right for Your Type seem particularly helpful for people with digestive issues. (You may want to purchase a blood typing kit online at Amazon.com to determine your blood type.).</p>

<p>Other healthy practices that can nourish and complement your Colon Hydrotherapy experience are deep breathing, castor oil packs, abdominal hot and cold packs, dry skin brushing, slant board, squatting, warm baths, massage and yoga. Gentle exercise such as walking, swimming, or trampolining is always beneficial. Herbal intestinal cleansers can accelerate your progress.</p>
