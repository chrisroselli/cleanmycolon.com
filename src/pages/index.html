    <h2>Colon Hydrotherapy</h2>
<p>
  Colon Hydrotherapy is an effective and safe way to achieve a clean colon. It has been practiced for centuries for its natural healing and restorative qualities. It is irrigation and “cleansing” of the rectum and large intestine through several safe, gentle infusions of temperature-varied, multi-filtered water. No chemicals or drugs are involved. My state-of-the-art FDA approved Dotolo Research equipment is unsurpassed in safety and hygiene. This closed system is both gentle and effective.

  <i>“Connie makes an otherwise intimidating experience very amenable. She creates such a peaceful, warm and inviting atmosphere, both in her physical space, and in her presence. She is a calming spirit, a real caregiver and has unparalleled knowledge about the field and health and well-being in general.”</i> – H.E., Branford, CT

    <h2>The Experience</h2>
<p>
  When you enter my Colon Hydrotherapy room, my attention is devoted to you completely. You can expect a nurturing, serene, and safe environment, where your utmost privacy and sense of well-being are always my concern. I take a bio-energetic approach focusing on balancing the lower chakras by releasing their emotional, mental, and spiritual blockages while assisting you in letting go physically. My clientele comments on my nurturing, compassionate nature and the trust and ease that they feel when they visit.
